# Unity GPU FFTOcean

NOTE: I did this at 2017.4;  

Inspired by https://github.com/speps/GX-EncinoWaves

Original paper is :

> Christopher J. Horvath. 2015.   
> [Empirical directional wave spectra for computer graphics.](http://dl.acm.org/authorize?N90195)   
> In Proceedings of the 2015 Symposium on Digital Production (DigiPro '15),   
> Los Angeles, Aug. 8, 2015, pp. 29-39. 

And I read these :

> Tessendorf J . Simulating Ocean Water[J]. Simulating Nature Realistic & Interactive Techniques Siggraph, 1999.
